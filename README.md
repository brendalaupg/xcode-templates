# Xcode Templates

Generate boilerplates for View Controllers for one of 4 types: `List`, `ListTable`, `Detail` and `Form`.
The goal is to be able to setup new feature screens that are compilable right after file creation.

## Setup

1. Navigate to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode`
2. Create the subfolders `Templates/File Templates/`
3. Clone this repository in `File Templates`
4. To verify that it's working, open up Xcode and create a new file in a project. Under iOS, scroll all the way down and you should see the `Custom` template


## Table Legend
